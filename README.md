# Vouchers case study

I present here my solution for handling vouchers and orders using Symfony and Mysql. <br />
First I created a migration. Database name is `gsg`. There are 2 tables: `order` and `voucher`.<br />
Than I created the 2 entities. <br />
I created the routes for all calls. <br />
Inside the repository folder are the sql queries. <br />
Controller folder holds the logic of the project. <br />
I attached the Postman calls as an json export (postman_vouchers.json).
